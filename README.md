# Encourage-Bot
This is my first bot created using python, to program I use the site "replit.com", in short the only files of the program are 'main.py' and 'keep_alive' the rest is up to the site.
To keep it alive I used a free account from the website 'uptimerobot.com'
This is the link of bot to use in your discord channel "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1133432221223637012&permissions=534723947584&scope=bot", enjoy !!!
